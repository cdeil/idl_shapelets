Here's one I made earlier!

These files are pre-made versions of the catalogues and variables created by
the shapelets_demo.pro routine. If you can't get part of that routine to work,
copy these up a directory and comment out the line that creates them. Then at
least you might be able to get the rest to work.

Files in this directory are:
example.sexcat          - SExtractor catalogue of example.fits
example.shapecat        - shapelet catalogue of example.fits
example_deconv.shapecat - shapelet catalogue of example.fits, deconvolved from
                          TinyTim model of the HST PSF
IDL_memory_dump_after_demo.sav
                        - This is an IDL-format file containing all of the
                          variables, as they are stored in memory, after running
                          shapelets_demo.pro. It can be loaded into IDL v6.0 or
                          later (on any platform), via
                       
                          restore,"data/pre-done/IDL_memory_dump_after_demo.sav",/verbose
                       
                          The structures of interest are:
                       
                          DECOMP          STRUCT    = -> <Anonymous> Array[1]
                          IMAGE           STRUCT    = -> <Anonymous> Array[1]
                          PSF             STRUCT    = -> <Anonymous> Array[1]
                          SEXCAT          STRUCT    = -> <Anonymous> Array[1]
                          SHAPECAT        STRUCT    = -> <Anonymous> Array[1]
